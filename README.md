## Why care?

Interop between [ECMAScript modules](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_modules.html#overview-syntax-of-ecmascript-modules), aka ES modules, aka ESM, aka [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), and [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html), aka CJS, modules is a complicated and confusing matter most JavaScript developers no doubt don't want to have to think about. There are more mission-critical things on which to spend time and brain cycles, namely application logic.

Still, it's consequential in the modern JS ecosystem for two reasons:

- Developers want to make use of the full treasury of NPM packages as dependencies, regardless of their module format, and regardless of the ultimate execution runtime environment (Node, browsers, cloud functions etc.).

- Developers increasingly enjoy authoring JavaScript as ESM, but still need to publish for execution in older runtime environments that don't fully support it.

Put another way, developers want to pretend everything is ESM and that it "just works". Unfortunately, however, it doesn't always.

While you certainly can use a tool that hides away and mostly handles interop concerns for you through encapsulated configuration of transpilation tools (Babel, TypeScript, bundlers, etc.), as many [front-end](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/supported-browsers-features) and [full-stack](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-babel-config) app framework build tools do, understanding the issues and solutions regarding module interop illuminates what those tools do under the hood. Knowledge is power, should something not "just work", which is bound to happen occassionally, given the [crazy number of possible scenarios](https://sokra.github.io/interop-test/). It also informs you to be selective and intentional about your tools, choosing the most appropriate one/s for a given use case (for example, bundlers probably aren't the best tool when publishing a Node library).

This article attempts to tie together disparate useful bits of info about module interop, which you would otherwise need to forage from many different sources, into the big picture. It focuses primarily on understanding and properly using interop-related settings in common JavaScript  development tools.

For those JavaScript developers impatient to get beyond the mess of interop and live now in our bright ESM-first future, I've also included [an addendum about that](#addendum).

<a name="tldr"></a>
## TL;DR

### To master this topic, read the official docs first.

- Node.js docs: ["Modules: CommonJS modules"](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)
- Node.js docs: ["Modules: ECMAScript modules"](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html)
- Node.js docs: ["Modules: Packages"](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html)
- MDN Web Docs: ["JavaScript modules"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

### Extra credit wonk reading. :nerd_face:

- Node.js docs: ["Modules: module API"](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html)
- Mozilla Hacks: ["ES modules: A cartoon deep dive"](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/)
- ECMAScript specification: [Modules](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules) (in case it helps… ["How to Read the ECMAScript Specification"](https://timothygu.me/es-howto/))

### :bangbang: Top things to know:

- **ESM is the future**, so strive to author in ESM for any new development.

  - For ESM-first web application development, transpile and bundle with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and explore [modern web dev](#esm-first-browser) techniques like [buildless dev servers](#buildless). The [rollup-starter-code-splitting]() demo shows a minimal example of how to use Rollup to bundle and code-split an app, but a more robust approach is presented at [Modern Web](https://modern-web.dev/guides/).

  - For ESM-first browser library development, transpile and bundle with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), and follow best practices in [this guide by the Skypack CDN](https://docs.skypack.dev/package-authors/package-checks) and checked by the [@skypack/package-check](https://github.com/skypackjs/package-check) tool. The Github Elements `<time>` custom element is [a good example](https://github.com/github/time-elements).

  - For ESM-first universal development...

  - For ESM-first Node package development, use one TypeScript, Babel (Babel can transpile TypeScript, btw), [ascjs](https://github.com/WebReflection/ascjs), or putout to transpile ESM source to CJS while maintaining separate modules. There's really no strict need to bundle for Node. Also be sure to signal ESM support to package consumers by declaring one or more ESM entrypoints using Node's conditional `"exports"` package.json field.

    Alternatively, though not ESM-first, you can avoid a transpilation step by authoring in CJS and using a thin ESM wrapper.

  - For migrating a CJS Node package to ESM, convert the code, ideally  and then follow this great guide by
    - (simplest option)

  - For ESM-first Node application development, use Node gte v13, add `"type": "module"` to your root package.json, use a `.js` extension for your application modules, author ESM without a build step, and take care to heed [ESM considerations described in Node's docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).


- **The future isn't quite here yet**, so fallback to pre-ESM support.

  If you prefer to not involve a build step, you can author using CJS

  - To support common browsers without ESM support, primarily IE 11 and non-Chromium Edge, transpile ESM source to IIFE or SystemJS.

  - To support Node before v13, transpile to CJS. One reasonable exception to this, however, is authoring a dual-support package for Node. In that case, it might be simplest to author in CJS and use a lightweight ESM wrapper that re-exports a CJS entry module.

- For the most seamless interop, use a build step involving a tool like Babel, TypeScript, esbuild, Rollup, Webpack, or Parcel that transforms code and adds helpers so imports from CJS and "faux" ESM modules (CJS module with an `exports.esModule` property) work nearly identically to ESM modules.

- CJS and ESM support for default exports *and* named exports in the same module is [fundamentally incompatible](#mixed-exports).

- When authoring a package in ESM targeting Node or universal consumption, [prefer only named exports](#prefer-named-exports).

- When authoring an app in ESM for Node, and importing a CJS module, [prefer only the default import](#prefer-default-import).

<a name="about"></a>

## How this material is organized

For an appreciation of why module interop is so confusing, take a look at the [interop tests](https://sokra.github.io/interop-test/) maintained by [Tobias Koppers](https://twitter.com/wsokra), creator of Webpack. The number of factors involved, and resulting set of possibilities, is vast. And, these tests don't even cover all the transpilation and bundling tools in use right now.

Luckily, it's possible to roughly boil down the possibilities into something mere humans can grasp, expressed through a conceptual framework:

- [**Build cases:**](#build-cases) The thing being built (e.g. browser application, package, node application), and the tools involved

- [**Run cases:**](#run-cases) The execution environment, and what is being executed

- [**Gotchas, Dos, and Don'ts:**](#gotchas-dos-and-donts) Warnings, practices to avoid, and best practices

Use cases and run cases are perspectives on interop that are useful at different points in a development lifecycle. The former is most pertinent to project setup, and covered here primarily in a how-to manner, centering on tools and their configuration and operation. The latter, a systematic breakdown of discrete sets of interop factors, is probably most useful for diagnosing what's going on when interop is the root case of runtime bugs.

Gotchas, dos and don'ts mostly apply for build cases, when developer action makes the difference, so you'll notice a lot of interlinking between those two kinds of sections below.

Crucial context about gotchas, dos, and don'ts, is also provided in the immediately following sections.

- [How code is transformed transpiling between ESM and CJS](#transpilation)

- [The role of package.json in interop](#package-json)

## Build cases

As mentioned in the addendum, Node's native ESM support since v13 makes it possible to not need a build step at all for interop, at least not when authoring Node applications. It's not too painful to run untranspiled [ESM in Node and import a mixture of ESM and CJS dependencies](#run-esm-node-import-cjs) ([avoid the reverse](#dont-run-cjs-with-esm-deps)). Just be aware of gotchas, dos, and don'ts.

Targeting browsers and Node versions lt v13 is another story. These cases invariably involve a mixture of ESM and CJS modules, but can only target CJS, for Node, and IIFEs, for browsers. All traces of ESM need to get transpiled.

- [Browser application](#browser-application)

- [Universal application](#universal-application) (for SSR)

- [Node application](#node-application)

- [Node package](#node-package)

<a name="browser-application"></a>

## Build case: Browser application

Chances are, as a JavaScript developer you most often encounter module interop when developing web applications for execution in the browser. This is because you likely author those using ESM syntax, but depend on packages from NPM, a majority of which are currently published as CJS or UMD modules (the JS ones, anyway).

Browsers do not understand CJS, however, so need to transpile and normalize all modules used, regardless of original format, to one of:

a. A single bundle file with an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) wrapper (example)
b. Multiple bundled and code-split files with IIFE wrappers, in tandem with a module loader "runtime" (example)
c. A single ESM bundle file (example)
d. Multiple bundled and code-split ESM files (example)

Module normalization occurs when a transpiler or bundler traverses a codebase, starting at entrypoint files, to read it into a graph of dependencies.  While doing this, the code of source files is parsed into an [AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)](https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/3aa601cf2aa498ab692d6d680fc26962/0fc5dc8feff3c4628687d0080f5931848be763f3) held in memory, and from this representation transformed and combined into the final faux modules output. Both Webpack and Rollup use Acorn.

Using the popular Webpack and Parcel bundlers, all traces of both ESM and CJS get wiped out in the final bundle output. They are replaced with faux modules, implemented using function scoping and a custom module cache in a bundler "[runtime](https://gist.github.com/johnloy/c7faabf72b358f8bc96ef9699031643e#file-bundle-js-L34-L88)". So, at the time application code executes in browsers, ESM-CJS interop is no longer a concern.


With the advent of widespread browser support of ESM (that is [*now*](https://caniuse.com/?search=javascript%20modules), btw), faux module runtimes aren't necessary for every application. Simply publish as ESM, if you don't need to support older browsers, like IE 11. Of course, for performance reasons, it's still desirable to combine many modules into fewer for production, and CJS dependency packages somehow need to get converted to ESM in the process.

The [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) bundler was [conceived to do precisely this](https://survivejs.com/blog/rollup-interview/).

## Run cases

There's only one run case where module interop doesn't come into play. That is when running ESM, with no imports, or only ESM imports, in browsers or [versions of Node supporting ESM](https://nodejs.medium.com/announcing-core-node-js-support-for-ecmascript-modules-c5d6dc29b663). As a developer you'll most likely encounter this case when producing or consuming a library targeting modern browsers, like [Lit](https://lit.dev/), or [web components](https://shoelace.style/).

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.0.0-beta.40/dist/components/dialog/dialog.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@2.0.0-beta.40/dist/components/button/button.js"></script>

<sl-dialog label="Dialog" class="dialog-width" style="--width: 50vw;">
  Web components are the future!
  <sl-button slot="footer" type="primary">OK</sl-button>
</sl-dialog>
```

Because not all CJS packages on NPM have been migrated to ESM, you're unlikely to encounter this case when only developing for Node (someday, though…).

This run case is covered in more detail in the [addendum about going ESM-first](#addendum).

All remaining cases are some variation of running ESM or CJS with dependencies on the opposite module format or a mixture of formats. What this means is that, at least until a good majority of [NPM packages migrate away from CJS](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/get-ready-for-esm-aa53530b3f77), module interop will remain an unavoidable fact of life.

Module interop cases are listed below, ordered most common to least (according to the author's totally unscientific ranking).

- [**IIFE, in the browser, with mixed ESM/CJS dependencies**](#run-iife-browser)

- [**ESM or CJS, in Node, importing "faux" ESM modules**](#run-import-faux)

- [**ESM, in the browser, with mixed ESM/CJS dependencies**](#run-esm-browser)

- [**ESM, in Node, importing CJS (not faux)**](#run-esm-node-import-cjs)

While running CJS and importing real ESM is theoretically another run case, it's [not advisable for Node development](#dont-run-cjs-with-esm-deps), If you do find yourself wanting to import ESM into CJS, however, the [Node ESM docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_import_expressions) can tell you all you need to know.

One understandable use case involving CJS importing ESM, though, is authoring configuration in ESM for development tools, like test runners, that haven't yet been made ESM-friendly. This might be desirable if the bulk of your project is written in ESM, and you want tool configuration to be able to consume some of your modules (a constants module, for example).

An additional run case is included below for this, **[ESM configs for CJS tools](#run-esm-configs-cjs-tools)**.

---

<a name="run-iife-browser"></a>

## Run case: IIFE, in the browser, with mixed ESM/CJS dependencies

This is the most common interop case involving bundling for broad cross-browser support.

---

<a name="run-import-faux"></a>

## Run case: ESM or CJS, in Node, importing faux ESM modules

[Faux](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/635#issuecomment-723177958) ESM modules are really CJS, but transpiled to include interop code transformations and possibly also interop helper functions. They are intended for use in toolchains involving transpilers, as those tools are equipped with smarts to treat faux modules as though they were real ESM modules. Node, however, does not have such smarts, and simply treats faux modules as CJS, resulting in awkward and unexpected import/require semantics (explained in more detail under the gotchas section). This case happens most often when consuming CJS Node libraries authored in TypeScript by developers unaware of the gotcha of having both default and named exports.

---

<a name="run-esm-browser"></a>

## Run case: ESM, in the browser, with mixed ESM/CJS dependencies

This is an increasingly common scenario of bundling for modern browsers with ESM support.

---

<a name="run-esm-node-import-cjs"></a>

## Run case: ESM, in Node, importing CJS (not faux)

This scenario is likely to occur when writing ESM Node apps (e.g. a server) without transpilation, as long as many NPM packages continue to be published as CJS only.

## Gotchas, dos, and don'ts

### :warning: ESM import specifiers need a file extension, but extensions are resolved for CJS

...

```javascript
import foo from 'foo.cjs'
```

### :warning: Node doesn't require file extensions in ESM for packages

...

### :warning: The same ESM import specifier might not work both in Node and browsers

...

<a name="mixed-exports"></a>
### :warning: CJS and ESM support for default exports *and* named exports in the same module is fundamentally incompatible.

How you expect it to work (ESM importing ESM)…
```javascript
// -- imported.mjs --------------------

// When ESM imports ESM, both named exports…
export const foo = 'foo';
export const bar = 'bar';

// …and default exports happily coexist.
export default 'baz'


// -- importer.mjs --------------------
import baz, { foo, bar } from './imported.mjs';
console.log(foo, bar, baz) // => 😃 foo bar baz
```

How it really works…
```javascript
// -- imported.cjs --------------------

// When ESM imports CJS, you can't have both named exports…
exports.foo = 'foo';
exports.bar = 'bar';

// …and a default export.
module.exports = 'baz';

// -- importer.mjs --------------------
import baz, { foo, bar } from './imported.cjs';
console.log(foo, bar, baz) // => 😭 undefined undefined baz
```

### :warning: Dynamic `import()` caches based on URL, not module

...

```javascript
import()
```

### :warning: Bundlers don't understand the Node-only workaround to `require()` in ESM

### :warning: Node interprets `exports.foo = 'foo'` and `module.exports = { foo: 'foo' }` differently importing into ESM

### :warning: Transpiling ESM to CJS changes `import()` behavior

The `import()` syntax is converted to a `require()` wrapped in a promise. That means, if the imported module isn't also transpiled, it can't be required, because `import()` always expects its specifier to refer to an ESM module. Also, ESM and CJS use differednt import/require caches and caching behaviors.

### :warning: YMMV importing JSON

CJS could always [import JSON files](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id) with `require('file.json')`, while support for this in ESM in Node is [currently experimental](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_json_modules), and simply non-existent in browsers (though a [feature proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules) has been put forward, and [a shim](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims#fetch-hook) exists).

### :warning: YMMV importing WebAssembly

Only ESM import semantics can directly support WebAssembly as a module, because WebAssembly instantiation is asynchronous (CommonJS dependency resolution is synchronous).

In CommonJS, the Node [WebAssembly global](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_webassembly) currently needs to be used to instantiate `.wasm` ([example](https://www.dynamsoft.com/codepool/use-webassembly-node-js.html)). In ESM, by contrast, `.wasm` can be directly imported in Node ([experimental at the moment](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_wasm_modules)), and treated more or less like any other dependency.

Browsers don't yet have this capability, though likely will soon, as well as the [ability to load `.wasm` using script tags](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/tree/master/proposals/esm-integration), `<script type="module" src="./app.wasm">`. Until that time, if you wish to take advantage of the ESM `.wasm` import syntax, you'll need to involve a build step, as with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) in conjunction with [@rollup/plugin-wasm](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/wasm) or something like [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/commands/build.html#target) to [wrap WASM instantiation](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/examples/without-a-bundler.html).

<a name="prefer-named-exports"></a>
### :white_check_mark:  Do prefer named exports when authoring a package in ESM targeting Node or universal consumption

  As a package author, you might write this (admittedly very contrived example)…
  ```javascript
  // -- foobarbaz.js --------------------
  export const foo = 'foo';
  export const bar = 'bar';
  export const baz = 'baz';
  export default foo + bar + baz;
  ```

  …and transpile it to a CJS "faux" module.
  ```javascript
  'use strict';

  Object.defineProperty(exports, '__esModule', { value: true });

  const foo = 'foo';
  const bar = 'bar';
  var foobarbaz = 'baz';

  exports.bar = bar;
  exports.default = foobarbaz;
  exports.foo = foo;
  ```

  Consumers of your package will expect the default export to be string `foobarbaz`, but it won't be unless they use a build step involving a transpiler that understands faux ESM modules!
  ```javascript
  // -- consumer.mjs --------------------
  import foobarbaz from 'foobarbaz'

  console.log(foobarbaz) // => { bar: 'bar', baz: 'baz', default: 'foobarbaz', foo: 'foo' }
  console.log(foobarbaz.default) // => foobarbaz

  // Wut! 😡


  // -- consumer.cjs --------------------
  const foobarbaz = require('foobarbaz')

  // Same deal. Ugh.
  console.log(foobarbaz) // => { bar: 'bar', baz: 'baz', default: 'foobarbaz', foo: 'foo' }
  console.log(foobarbaz.default) // => foobarbaz
  ```

  Avoid confusion by avoiding a default export
  ```javascript
  // -- foobarbaz.js --------------------
  export const foo = 'foo';
  export const bar = 'bar';
  export const baz = 'baz';
  export const foobarbaz = foo + bar + baz;


  // -- consumer.js --------------------
  import { foobarbaz } from 'foobarbaz';
  // Using `import foobarbaz from 'foobarbaz';` with a transpiler should error

  console.log(foobarbaz) // => foobarbaz
  ```

### :white_check_mark: Do prefer the default import when authoring an app in ESM for Node, and importing a CJS module

The default import of a CJS module into an ESM module in Node is dependably the value of `exports` from the imported module. Accessing it will never throw and the value will never be `undefined`.<br>

A highly possible scenario.
```javascript
// -- imported.cjs ----------------

// It's tempting to think of this as a collection of named exports
module.exports = {
  foo: 'foo',
  bar: 'bar',
  baz: 'baz'
}


// importer.mjs
import { foo, bar, baz } from './imported.cjs';
console.log(foo, bar, baz) // => 💥 SyntaxError: Named export 'bar' not found.
```

Why?
```javascript

```

### :white_check_mark: Do use the `main` and `module` package.json fields when publishing a hybrid package intended for web bundling

...

### :white_check_mark: Do use package.json conditional `exports` mappings when publishing a hybrid package intended for Node

...

### :white_check_mark: Do use an .mjs extension for entry files when transpiling for Node

In scenarios 4 and 5 above there's occassionally an additional factor of whether the transpilation entry file (e.g. `entry` config setting in Webpack) has a `.js` or `.mjs` extension. The Babel and Webpack tools vary how they transpile to CJS when the entry file ends in `.mjs`, to attempt to match Node's behavior when importing CJS into ESM.

### :white_check_mark: Do use a .js extension for entry files when transpiling for browsers

...

### :white_check_mark: Do publish a migration to ESM (or dual module support) as a semver major change

...

### :no_entry_sign: Don't treat properties of `module.exports` in a CJS module imported into ESM as named exports

...

### :no_entry_sign: Don't use both default and named exports for a package when transpiling ESM to CJS

This scenario occurs when Node library authors using a `default` export transpile from ESM before publishing as CJS, using TypeScript for example, but consumers of the library are expecting vanilla CJS.

https://remarkablemark.org/blog/2020/05/05/typescript-export-commonjs-es6-modules/

### :no_entry_sign: Don't use `"type": "module"` in the project root package.json for hybrid packages

...

<a name="dont-run-cjs-with-esm-deps"></a>

### :no_entry_sign: Don't run a CJS application in Node with ESM dependencies

Because imports of ESM into CJS are always async, accessed by way of promises returned from dynamic `import()`, ESM imports can never function like top-level declarative dependencies (e.g. `require() calls at the top of a CJS module). Save yourself interop headaches, as well as the coordination necessary when introducing async into your logic, and just use CJS throughout.

## :sparkles: Addendum: Why and how to go ESM-first

You no longer *need* bundling, or even any kind of of build step, any more during web development, thanks to [broad browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=javascript%20modules) of ESM, and [modern tooling](https://modern-web.dev/) to help take advantage of that. Of course, for production, bundling is still probably [optimal for performance reasons](https://v8.dev/features/modules#performance), at least until [resource bundling](https://github.com/WICG/resource-bundles) is possible (part of an emerging suite of standards to support better [website packaging](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage)).

Likewise, since full ESM support [arrived in Node v13](https://nodejs.medium.com/announcing-core-node-js-support-for-ecmascript-modules-c5d6dc29b663), you've not needed a build step if you wanted to mix and match ESM and CJS in Node. [Deno](https://deno.land/manual/examples/import_export), if you're living on the edge, has offered ESM support since its inception.

These days, it's *possible* to start and end JavaScript development using only ESM throughout.

## ESM-first with browsers

ESM support in browsers opens up new possibilities around improving DX through the practice of so-called "[buildless development](https://buildless.site/)", as well as some [interesting production performance benefits](https://jspm.org/import-map-cdn).

Unfortunately, in spite of great browser support, one still can't often blithely author entire web applications using ESM. If you want to use NPM packages as dependencies, there remains the pesky problem of consuming CommonJS in your ESM code. Web developers have also grown accustomed to the ergonomics of using ESM in some ways not directly supported by browsers ([yet](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/css-modules-v1-explainer.md)), like importing non-JS assets into JS modules (Webpack spoiled us) and HMR.

Several kinds of tools are emerging to overcome the interop obstacle, as well as to layer back on DX ergonomics missing from the vanilla ESM web development experience:

- [Buildless dev servers](#buildess)
- [ESM-friendly CDNs](#cdns)
- [Dependency pre-building](#pre-building)

### Buildess dev servers

Buildless dev servers in essence leave separate modules as such during development, because browsers can now load them natively and quickly without bundling. Noteworthy current choices for buildless dev servers include:

- [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/)
- [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/concepts/how-snowpack-works)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

To varying degrees these each also support on-demand code transformations making import-anything, HMR, environment variable injection, and cross-browser support possible. These transformations occur only when files are requested by the browser from the dev server, which when combined with caching makes rebuilds extremely fast after code changes.

### ESM friendly CDNs

ESM-friendly CDNs provide urls for loading ESM versions of packages directly into a browser using `<script type="module" src="...">` and `<script type="module"> import from "..." </script>`. Noteworthy current choices for these include:
- [Skypack.dev](https://www.skypack.dev/)
- [esm.run](https://www.jsdelivr.com/esm) by [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
- [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/)
- [JSPM](https://jspm.org/docs/cdn)
- [Unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)

>  ℹ️ You might notice the popular [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) missing from this list. At the moment, it doesn't appear to directly support ESM, only IIFE and UMD.

Using these CDNs makes it possible to avoid installing and bundling dependency packages altogether, if that's acceptable for your application hosting needs. At a minimum these support the ability of a loaded module to subsequently load its full dependency graph. Most of them, however, also provide automatic conversion of CJS to ESM,  as well as production-oriented performance optimizations like:
- minification
- compression
- HTTP caching
- ES waterfall optimization (mod1 loads mod2 loads mod3…)

One very intriguing optimization, only supported by JSPM right now, is utilizing the capability of ES module import maps (currently only supported by Chrome) to enable [perfect individual caching of both dependent and dependency modules](https://jspm.org/import-map-cdn#module-cdns).

<a name="pre-building"></a>

### Dependency pre-building

If the quantum leap to loading all dependencies from CDNs is too drastic, but you'd still enjoy the comfort of treating any NPM package as ESM without having to care about CJS interop, use pre-built dependency packages. This option normalizes everthing to ESM while installing packages locally. It comes in two flavors: pre-built by somebody else, and pre-built by you.

The first option basically amounts to only using packages that ship an ESM variant, or using a fork of an original CJS package. Forks obviously aren't ideal because they can fall out of date. Still, you might locate a needed pre-built fork at https://github.com/esm-bundle/ or https://github.com/bundled-es-modules, or get lucky hunting for forks in the NPM registry (tip: [search using jDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?query=*%20type%3A%20esm)). This variety of pre-built ESM package will install locally into node_modules, because they are normal NPM packages.

The second option can be acheived by using [esinstall](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esinstall), a tool that powers the Snowpack buildless dev server. It uses Rollup under the hood to resolve package entrypoints under `node_modules`—these can be either CJS or ESM—and output an optimally bundled *and* split set of new modules. Exactly how they are bundled and split depends on your application's unique set of dependencies and their transitive dependencies, but suffice it to say there'll be no duplication of transitive dependencies in the output. A good explanation of the rationale for this approach can be found [in the Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/dep-pre-bundling.html#the-why). When pre-building packages this way, rather than consuming packages directly from `node_modules`, you will typically install them under your web application's source directoy into a sub-directory like `web-modules` (that's [what Snowpack does](https://www.snowpack.dev/concepts/how-snowpack-works#using-npm-dependencies)).

## ESM-first with Node and NPM

ESM ostensibly provides less benefit for the Node ecosystem, which has gotten along well for years on CommonJS, than web. Still, ESM is the future of JavaScript modules, and Node developers will [come to rely on and publish](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/get-ready-for-esm-aa53530b3f77) ESM as a matter of convention in Node-only packages.
